# CantinaCodingChallenge

***How to Get Started***

- You're going to have run "**bundle install***" in your IO.

- run "**ruby cantina.rb**" to start the program.

  -> Then type the selector of your choice.
  
  **Features of this Application**

This tool can be used to parse through the SystemViewController.json file that was provided and gather views that match the selected ClassName, Identifier, or Class of your choice.

These inputs are recognized in the code by the symbols/characters that preceeds them.
        EX:ClassName will be started with a '.', an Identifier will be started with a '#', and a Class will be preceeded by nothing. 
This is very similar to the naming convention when working with CSS.

        **Technologies I Used When Developing**
       I used both JavaScript and Ruby to get this application started. I used JavaScript to save the data to an object where then I parsed through it with 3 recursive methods that were coded in Ruby.
       I hadn't used recursive methods in a decent amount of time so I looked more into them again to bring me up to speed with what the assignment needed
       
       **Future Features**
       
       I would like to add testing to this application because I feel like it would better practice the common development process.
